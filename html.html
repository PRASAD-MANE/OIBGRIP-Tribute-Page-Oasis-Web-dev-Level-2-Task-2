                        <h2>Pushpa.. Pushpa Raj</h2>
                        <p>Namm sunke flower samje kya, fire hain mein !</p>
                    </div>
                    <p> Pushpa Raj is a coolie who works to smuggle red sandalwood, a rare wood that
                        only grows in the Seshachalam Hills of the Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh. When DSP
                        Govindappa raids them in the forest, Pushpa hides and recovers the stock, thereby gaining the
                        trust of his employer Konda Reddy. With the help of novel ideas to smuggle the red sandalwood,
                        he quickly rises through the ranks and becomes Konda Reddy's partner.

                        Mangalam Srinu, a merciless dealer who manages the red sandalwood syndicate entrusts Konda Reddy
                        to keep 200 tons of his stock safe. As Konda's younger brother, Jolly Reddy is deemed
                        incompetent, Pushpa is given the job. Govindappa attempts to raid them but Pushpa throws all the
                        logs into the river, saving it from being seized. At a party, Pushpa overhears that Srinu is
                        selling the wood at a much higher rate than what they're paid. He asks Konda to demand a fair
                        share but backs down as going against Srinu seems risky.

                        Pushpa meets Srivalli and instantly falls for her. On their engagement day, his half-brother
                        Mohan denies Pushpa's lineage because he was born out of wedlock while his mother is injured in
                        the ensuing scuffle. This angers Pushpa, which motivates him to rise higher in life. The next
                        day, he smuggles the wood to Chennai and meets Srinu from whom he demands ₹1 crore (US$130,000)
                        per ton as their share. 

                        Jolly blackmails Srivalli to spend a night with him while holding her father captive. Enraged,
                        Pushpa badly beats up Jolly, temporarily paralyzing him. Konda, finding out that Pushpa is
                        responsible for his brother's condition, tries to kill him but Srinu's men ambush them. Amid the
                        confusion, Pushpa manages to counterattack them. Konda is killed but Pushpa saves Konda's
                        brother Jakka Reddy. He also captures Srinu's brother-in-law Mogileesu and kills him. MP
                        Bhumireddy Siddappa Naidu arranges a truce between Pushpa and Srinu and appoints Pushpa to
                        manage their syndicate.

                        While Pushpa is at his prime, a ruthless police officer Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat takes charge as
                        the district's SP. Pushpa offers him a bribe of ₹1 crore (US$130,000). Shekhawat, however,
                        intimidates and ridicules Pushpa for his lineage and not giving respect by addressing him as
                        "Sir". Pushpa gets angry by this insult and fists his fingers. Shekhawat threatens to shoot his
                        hand if Pushpa does not unfold his fingers. In a desperate situation, Pushpa backs down and
                        leaves the station. On the night of Pushpa's wedding, Pushpa and Shekhawat drink together.
                        Expressing contempt on how he was ridiculed in their first meeting, Pushpa takes Shekhawat's
                        revolver and shoots himself in his hands. He pressures Shekhawat to get undressed while he also
                        does the same. Pushpa says that his stature as that of a syndicate boss remains the same
                        nonetheless while Shekhawat is nothing without his police uniform to the extent that even his
                        dog would not recognize him if he is naked. Pushpa leaves for his wedding while Shekhawat goes
                        back home semi-naked. As predicted, his dog barks at him. Enraged, Shekhawat kills the dog and
                        burns the bribe money given by Pushpa.
